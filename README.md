# NPM Scripts

View and run NPM scripts from the sidebar

**Now supports Workspaces!**

# Demo

![NPM Scripts](https://github.com/Duroktar/vscode-npm-scripts/raw/master/media/demo.gif "Demo")

# Usage

Open the NPM SCRIPTS section in the sidebar to view all
scripts in the projects package.json file. Click on one
to start it in the console. Each instance gets its own
console tab based on the script name, so running multiple
scripts at the same time is no problem.

## Configuration

{
...
"npm-scripts.showStartNotification": false // Disables dropdown notification
...
}

## Development

* Open this example in VS Code
* `npm install`
* `npm run compile`
* `F5` to start debugging
